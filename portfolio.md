## [Project 1: Topic Modeling on Academic Texts]
## [Project 2: Music Recommender System]
## [Project 3: Early Sepsis Prediction with ICU data]
## [Project x: Times Series Forecasting Walmart Sales Prediction](https://glosolin.github.io/Time_Series_Walmart_Sales_Forecasting/)  
Developed time series models using ARIMA/SARIMA and Gaussian Processes to predict Walmart's weekly sales, enhancing decision-making with precise demand predictions.
- Forecasted Walmart's weekly sales employing ARIMA/SARIMA and Gaussian Processes, leveraging time series models to support data-driven decision-making.
- Conducted drill-down analysis and aggregated datasets to optimize model performance across different product categories and states, enhancing forecast granularity.
- Utilized grid search to fine-tune hyperparameters, achieving precise model calibration and a MAPE of 2.31%, indicating high accuracy.
